# Aurora Engineering — Service Page (example)

This is a simple static page representing an engineering service: "Single Diagram Gauge" — custom diagram/gauge design, calibration, and integration.

Theme colors: red, gray and white.

Files:

- `index.html` — the service page HTML
- `styles.css` — CSS with variables for the red/gray/white theme and responsive rules

- `products.html` — products listing page (clone-style) with client-side search & category filter

Open the page:

PowerShell:

```powershell
start "" "product-page\index.html"
```

Or open `product-page/index.html` in your browser.

Notes:
- The page shows service options and CTAs: "Request quote" and "Contact sales" (mailto).
- If you want a working contact form, integration with a backend, or different deliverable examples, tell me which one and I can add it.
 
Products listing:

- Open `product-page/products.html` to see the products grid. It includes a simple search box and category filter implemented in vanilla JS.

Notes about cloning the reference site:
- This is an approximation (layout & functionality) of a products listing; content and images are placeholder/unsplash.
- I did not copy proprietary content verbatim. Provide your product descriptions, images, and pricing and I will replace them.
